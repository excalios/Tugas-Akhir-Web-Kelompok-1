                As December kicks off, we’ve got a new lineup of games
                joining PC Game Pass to round off 2022. This month’s first
                round-up of games consists of a variety of different titles.
                There’s a good mix of new and classic games this month with
                a few that are definitely worth trying out. So, let’s jump
                straight in and see what’s in store.
                <br /><br />
                Starting today, three games will be available for PC Game
                Pass to start off December 2022. First off is Eastward, a
                retro-inspired RPG about a society on the brink of collapse,
                all told through a striking art style. Then there’s The
                Walking Dead: The Final Season. And its arrival on PC Game
                Pass means that you can play the entire series from Telltale
                Games from start to finish. Finally, players can check out
                Totally Reliable Delivery Service, which is a great way to
                test your friendships.
                <br /><br />
                Elsewhere in the month are some big titles. Lego Star Wars:
                The Skywalker Saga lands on December 6. And it’s also joined
                by the day one launch of Hello Neighbor 2. So you can catch
                both of these games for the upcoming game of the year
                discussions. Then, on December 8, Chained Echoes, a
                16-bit-styled RPG lands on PC Game Pass. Other games
                rounding off the month then include High on Life, from Rick
                and Morty creator Justin Roiland, and Potion Craft on
                December 13. Next, on December 15, there’s Hot Wheels
                Unleashed and Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan.
                This brings the total of new games coming to PC Game Pass in
                this half of December 2022 to 10.
